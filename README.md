Business Problem and Context:

E-News Express is an online news portal that offers it’s users an easy and quick access to updates on
day-to-day global events with a subscribe option.
Executives at E-News suspect that there has been a decrease in subscribers from the previous year due to
the current website’s weak outline and lack of engaging content.
The design team has created a new landing page with a new outline and more relevant content in an
effort to gain more subscribers by prolonging the time visitor’s spend on it’s portal.
E-News would like to test effectiveness of the new landing page in gaining more subscribers.

Solution Approach:

Multiple hypothesis tests are conducted on a randomly selected sample of 100 users. The users are
divided into two groups: Control and Treatment. The control group is served the existing landing page,
while the treatment group is tested on the new landing page. The effectiveness of the new landing
page will be judged by answering the following important questions:
● Do users spend more time on the new landing page than on the existing one?
● Is the conversion rate(proportion of visitor’s who subscribe) for the new page greater than the rate
for the existing one?
● Does the converted status depend on the preferred language?
● Is the time spent on the new page the same for different language users?
Prior to conducting the hypothesis tests, EDA will be presented to provide a thorough understanding of
the data.
